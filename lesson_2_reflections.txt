Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A: It creates metadata in the .git directory.

Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area shows the files that you've either changed or added and will be committing to git.  It allows you to identify exactly which files will be updated/added in the commit.
